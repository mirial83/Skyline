Step 1
Welcome to the CSS Variables Skyline project! Start by adding the 
!DOCTYPE html declaration at the top of the document so the browser 
knows what type of document it's reading.

Step 2
Add opening and closing html tags below the DOCTYPE so you have 
a place to start putting some code. Be sure to set the language to English.

Step 3
Next, add opening and closing head and body tags within the html element.

Step 4
Within the head, nest a meta element with a charset of UTF-8, a title 
element with a title of City Skyline, and a link element that links 
your styles.css file.
